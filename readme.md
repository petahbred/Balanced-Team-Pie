# BalancedTeamPie

A balanced team pie implementation. Each member of a group will have a same set of skills displayed on a pie chart. Each user will then select their skill level in each of the slices of the pie for each skill. The project manager will then average the skill levels for the team.

My implementation included all the files prefixed with PSR.
	 This consists of drawing the Pie Graph, creating touch handlers for where the skill level will be placed. Drawing the different levels on to the pie graph, and pulling from the server the member's different skill levels.
